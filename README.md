# NeuralSnake
Small C++ jam to program a neural network that is able to learn to play Snake.

Snake is implemented with **OpenGL**, with the option to use the *IrrKlang* library for sound, and the *SOIL* library for loading images in OpenGL.

## Running Neuralsnake
* Download the repository
* In terminal, cd to the downloaded folder
* *'make'*
* *'./neuralsnake'* for seeing the neural network in action, *'./neuralsnake -u'* to play snake for yourself

## Current state of development
Just started, no Neural Network implemented yet. You can play snake yourself already though!
